I'm an undergrad @ UNC-Chapel Hill studying **Computer Science**, Neuroscience, and Applied Engineering. I'm passionate about **computer graphics** and **vision**, **optics**, and **brain-computer interfaces** â€“ all of which are crucial to the field of **XR**! If I'm not developing XR experiences, I'm busy doing one of the following:

- ðŸ¥½ Leading [Carolina AR/VR](https://linktr.ee/carvr) and [ICXR](https://www.icxr.org/)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about **optics**, **imaging and displays**, **electronics and sensors**, and **assembly programming**
