### Hi there, Ashley here! 👋

I'm an Junior @ UNC-Chapel Hill studying **Computer Science**, **Neuroscience**, and **Applied Engineering**. I'm passionate about computer graphics, computational displays (imaging, optics, haptics, BCIs), and human perception – all of which are crucial to improve XR systems. If I'm not developing XR experiences, I'm busy doing one of the following:

- 🔭 Researching in the [UNC Graphics and Virtual Reality Group](https://telepresence.web.unc.edu/)
- 🥽 Leading [Carolina AR/VR](https://uncarvr.org/)
- Advising [Intercollegiate XR](https://www.icxr.org/) _(after an exhilarating time as Co-President throughout 2024)_
- 👩‍💻 Developing cool [projects](https://aneall.github.io/projects.html)
- ⿻ Creating [art](https://aneall.github.io/designs.html)
- 🍪 Baking!
- 📖 [Teaching](https://aneall.github.io/teaching.html) people XR

🌱 I’m currently applying the skills I've learned through graduate-level courses and research to my undergraduate honors thesis.
