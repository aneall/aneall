### Hi there, Ashley here! 👋

I'm an Junior @ UNC-Chapel Hill studying **Computer Science**, **Neuroscience**, and **Applied Engineering**. I'm passionate about computer graphics, computational displays (imaging, optics, haptics, BCIs), and human perception – all of which are crucial to improve XR systems. If I'm not developing XR experiences, I'm busy doing one of the following:

- 🥽 Leading [Carolina AR/VR](https://linktr.ee/carvr) and co-leading [ICXR](https://www.icxr.org/)
- 🔭 Researching in the [UNC Graphics and Virtual Reality Group](https://telepresence.web.unc.edu/)
- 👩‍💻 Hacking to create cool [projects](https://aneall.github.io/projects.html)
- ⿻ Creating [art](https://aneall.github.io/portfolio.html)
- 🍪 Baking!
- 📖 Teaching people XR

🌱 I’m currently learning applying all of the skills I've learned through graduate-level courses and research to work on my honors thesis.
