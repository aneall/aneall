### Hi there, Ashley here! 👋

I'm an undergrad @ UNC-Chapel Hill studying **Computer Science** – minoring in **Neuroscience** and **Applied Engineering**. I'm passionate about **computer graphics** and **vision**, **optics**, and **multisensory interfaces** – all of which are crucial to the field of **XR**! If I'm not developing XR experiences, I'm busy doing one of the following:

- 🥽 Leading [Carolina AR/VR](https://linktr.ee/carvr) and co-leading [ICXR](https://www.icxr.org/)
- 🔭 Researching in the [Telepresence Lab](https://telepresence.web.unc.edu/)
- 👩‍💻 Working on [projects](https://aneall.github.io/projects.html)
- ⿻ Creating [art](https://aneall.github.io/portfolio.html)
- 🍪 Baking!
- 📖 Teaching people XR

🌱 I’m currently learning about **optics**, **imaging and displays**, **electronics and sensors**, and **assembly programming**
